 * Generates the column setup for the grid.

 * There are markers at each quarter in time, with each quarter having a start and end marker.
 * A marker is named <day>-<hours>-<minutes>-start and <day>-<hours>-<quarters>-end.
 * The start line of a given quarter is equal to the end line of the quarter before it.
 * The end line of a given quarter is thus also equal to the start line of the quarter after it.
 * The column width is equal to the variable 'segmentSpace', except if the column is between 4 and 11 AM (exclusive). If they are, their width is set to 0.
 * The columns are prepended with an extra column for showing the room names, which is marked by marker lines named 'start-header' and 'end-header' and has a width of min-content.
 * In it's totality, it'll look something like this (with certain times ommitted for readability):
 * [start-header] min-content [end-header FRIDAY-16-0-start] segmentSpace [FRIDAY-16-0-end FRIDAY-16-15-start] segmentSpace [FRIDAY-16-15-end FRIDAY-4-15-start] 0px [FRIDAY-4-15-end]
